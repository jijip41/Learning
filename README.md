## CSS Architecture

*Questions to consider*
1. Why are CSS naming conventions useful?
2. When might Specificity become a problem?
3. How can composition help us build UIs?
---

### CSS naming convention?
- Use hyphen Delimited string
>e.g.

>.redBox{...} (X)
<br>
.red-box{...} (O)

- The BEM naming convention - more structured naming convention // It is used for larger, more interrelated pieces of UI that require a number of classes

> Hyphens for blocks - The sole root of the component
> Underscores for elements - A component part of the Block
> Double hyphens for modifiers - A variant or extension of the Block
<br>

### JavaScript Hooks?
- Do not bind your CSS and JS ooto the same class in HTML. 
- It is much cleaner, more transparent, and more maintainable to bind JS onto specific classes

>e.g.
><input type="submit" class="btn  js-btn" value="Follow" />```

### Why CSS naming conventions?
- Know what a selector does, just by looking at its name (what type of thing a class does)
- have an idea of where a selector(class) can be used, just by looking at it
- know the relationships between class names, by looking at them


### Conlusion
- CSS is difficult to maintain and keep stylesheets maintainable is important.
- By using CSS naming convention, code will always look and feel familiar to all members of the team, especially when is involved in big projects.
- The BEM approch ensures that everyone who participates in projects works with a single codebase and speaks the same language. 
- Increase development speed, debugging and the implementation of new features in legacy code.  
- To make stylesheets maintainable, I should keep code transparent, sane and readable
- Then I can keep my stylesheets scalable.

### CSS Specificity?
- Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and therefore, applied.
### CSS Specificity Rules?
- The browser uses the source order (i.e the cascade) of the CSS stylesheet to determine which CSS property values are the most relevant to apply to an element.
- This rule applies when the CSS selectors have equal specificity.

- The higher the specificity of a CSS selector, the more likely that browsers will apply its CSS declarations over another. 

### Why problems? 
- No matter how well considered your naming, regardless of how perfect your source order and cascade are managed, and how well youâ€™ve scoped your rulesets, just one overly-specific selector can undo everything.
- If I use hugely over-specific selector, it's trumping the specificity of the one defined later- working against CSS' source-order based application of styles. 
- Then I will have to refactor my CSS and HTML or write a more specific selector to override it --> **Think about time and cost!**
- If I go with writing a more specific selector option, I will nedd another selector to override it. 

### Specificity can...
- limit your ability to extend and manipulate a codebase
- interrupt and undo CSS' cascading, ingeriting nature
- cause avoidable verbosity in your project
- prevent things from working as expected when move into different environments
- lead to serious developer frustration

### Simpliest tips for easier life when writing CSS
- try and keep specificity as low as possible at all times.
- make sure there isn't a lof ov variance between selectors in your codebase
- not using IDs in your CSS
- not nesting selectors
- not qualifying classes
- not chaining selectors
